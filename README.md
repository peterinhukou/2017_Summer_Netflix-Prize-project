# 2017_Summer_Netflix-Prize-project
This is my practicum project in summer 2017. I select Netflix prize as my project.
The reason I select Netflix is it is very new to me. It is my first time to handle so many files (17770 txt files) 
in such a big size (more than 100 million ratings, the aggregated file larger than 2GB). I need to conside the limitation of my memory size (I use R), need to get familiar with AWK script 
in Cygwin environment, and need to get familiar with recommenderlab package.
